	<em><p>Illinois is in its eleventh month without a budget, leaving some mental health care providers without large portions of their funding. Some clinics have shut down, some are tapping lines of credit and others are trying new ways to stay afloat to serve the people who depend on them.</p></em></div>

	Chicago Teachers Union vs. CPS clash to escalate as Claypool seeks damages</a></p></b>
	<p><em>Chicago Teachers Union and other labor members picketed in solidarity across neighborhoods, on college campuses and throughout the Loop during rush hour April 1. But the so-called “Day of Action” might stretch into months as Chicago Public Schools leaders acted out themselves mid-afternoon, seeking monetary damages from the union for what they say was an illegal walkout.</em></p>
